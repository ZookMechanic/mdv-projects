				<p>My theme from this week is about surviving the longest on the map "Ascension" from the Call of Duty: Black Ops video game.  It's definitely my favorite map to play from the series.  You are only given a small amount of money in the beginning.  There is a random weapons box that can either help or hurt your gameplay.  You really want to get a couple of good guns to progress through the levels higher than ten.</p>
				<p>There are also three elevators to move you around in case you get into a bind of some sort.  Once you ride each of those once then the giant rocket takes off unlocking the upgrade machine.  Each weapon you want to upgrade costs 5,000 dollars.</p>
				<p>Also you have to figure in that each door costs money to open and you have to have a little strategy when opening doors to keep some of the zombies at bay.  My routine is to usually run circles as much as possible to build up points to buy stuff.  I believe running solo I've gotten to just over level twenty.</p>
