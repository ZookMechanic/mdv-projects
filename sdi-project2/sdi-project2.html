<p>This project leaves off from Round 5 in the starting room.  You should have enough points to open the top door and move out into the level.  If you followed my strategy from the last project you can probably get to the Weapon Box also.</p>
<p>Throughout these levels, try and open the doors with the Lunar landers and ride them at least once to launch the rocket.  This will unlock the Power Room so you can upgrade your current weapons.</p>
<p>I try not to but if the zombies get a little "handsy" go ahead and find the Juggernaut power up which increases your health resistance.  I use these levels to unlock everything important and get some good weapons to set the tone.</p>
