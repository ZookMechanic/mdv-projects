<p>This week I chose to keep the same theme as before.  I just refactored the code where necessary and added a few more things to comply with the flowchart.  I started a new job which is turning out to be ten times better than the last one I had.  There is so much more work to be done.</p>
<p>I am mainly focusing on the closing aspect of my day.  That in itself has many tasks to accomplish.  So, this story just tells what I do when the doors close at the end of the day.</p>
